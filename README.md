# Gitlab exporter

Simple prometheus exporter that exposes basic stats about
projects in gitlab.

This is a work in progress and will not work without editing the source.

## Installation

For the moment you will have to change the constants in `cmd/gitlab-exporter/main.go` for your specific gitlab instance. This will be solved using command line parameters in the future.
